# Playing-Game-Using-Movement-Tracking.
In this project, I have converted face movement into keyboard commands like Up, Down, Left, Right.I used facial landmarks to detect face and get the nose out of it for better referencing.We can play games like "Temple Run", "Subway Surfer",etc in which the character moves forward automatically without any key pressing.               One disadvantage is that we have to come back again at the same position after each movement.So I am working on another modifying version in which position change will be w.r.t the previous position.So here, we don't need to set position again and again.
